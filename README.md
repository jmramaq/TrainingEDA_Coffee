EDA made in my spare time for training purposes. Based on the Coffee Quiality database from Kaggle.

Will add a quality coffee prediction using different algorythms.

It's still a WIP so updates and changes in text, code and graphs will be common.

All texts are in spanish, but expect a translated version anytime soon.
